# dataloader
Exercise done within a subject "Introduction to deep learning" @ Technical University of Munich.
The goal was to create a dataloader class, which is used to load small subsets of the dataset at a time (mini-batches). 
For the implementation of the dataset we used the Cifar10-image-dataset. the implementation included loading the images from disc, data visualization and creating a __get_item__ 
method to get hold of each image. As I cannot share the code for that, here I am using a simple DummyDataset.
